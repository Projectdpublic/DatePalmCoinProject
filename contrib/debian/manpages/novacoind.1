.SH DESCRIPTION
This  manual page documents the DatePalmCoind program. DatePalmCoin is a peer-to-peer digital currency. Peer-to-peer (P2P) means that there is no central authority to issue new money or keep track of transactions. Instead, these tasks are managed collectively by the nodes of the network. Advantages:

DatePalmCoins can be sent easily through the Internet, without having to trust middlemen. Transactions are designed to be irreversible. Be safe from instability caused by fractional reserve banking and central banks. The limited inflation of the DatePalmCoin systemâ€™s money supply is distributed evenly (by CPU power) throughout the network, not monopolized by banks.

Sets the ['account'] associated with the given address. ['account'] may be omitted to remove an address from ['account'].
.TP
\fBgetaccountaddress 'account'\fR
Returns a new DatePalmCoin address for 'account'.
.TP

.TP
\fBgetdifficulty\fR
Returns the proof-of-work difficulty as a multiple of the minimum difficulty.
.TP
\fBgetgenerate\fR
Returns boolean true if server is trying to generate DatePalmCoins, false otherwise.
.TP
\fBsetgenerate 'generate' ['genproclimit']\fR
Generation is limited to ['genproclimit'] processors, -1 is unlimited.
.TP
\fBgethashespersec\fR
Returns a recent hashes per second performance measurement while generating.
.TP
\fBgetinfo\fR
Returns an object containing server information.
.TP
\fBgetnewaddress 'account'\fR
Returns a new DatePalmCoin address for receiving payments. If 'account' is specified (recommended), it is added to the address book so payments received with the address will be credited to 'account'.
.TP
\fBgetreceivedbyaccount 'account' ['minconf=1']\fR
Returns the total amount received by addresses associated with 'account' in transactions with at least ['minconf'] confirmations.
.TP
\fBgetreceivedbyaddress 'DatePalmCoinaddress' ['minconf=1']\fR
Returns the total amount received by 'DatePalmCoinaddress' in transactions with at least ['minconf'] confirmations.
.TP
\fBgettransaction 'txid'\fR
Returns information about a specific transaction, given hexadecimal transaction ID.
.TP
\fBgetwork 'data'\fR
If 'data' is specified, tries to solve the block and returns true if it was successful. If 'data' is not specified, returns formatted hash 'data' to work on:

    "midstate" : precomputed hash state after hashing the first half of the data.
